{"name":"Arch-geronimo","tagline":"","body":"**Simple install script for Arch Lnux written in bash**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a project for me to learn bash, it's noobishly written but works fine for me. On a good internet connecton it can install Arch in under 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe installation process is aimed for new Arch users and closely follows the beginners installation guide (see ArchWiki).\r\n\r\nCurrent features:\r\n* Install Archlinux on a MBR disk with one swap and one root partition.\r\n* Set up locale/timezone/hostname and user with root privileges\r\n* Install AUR helper yaourt\r\n* Perform fontconfig patch 'infinality' for better font rendering\r\n* Install Xorg server, synaptic input drivers and one base DE (gnome, cinnamon, kde, xfce or lxde)\r\n* Install intel graphics drivers plus nvidia/amd drivers (proprietary or open-source)\r\n\r\nThere is no support for advanced features like UEFI/GPT. But, due to the modular structure a simple script can be written to achieve this task.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n**Instructions**\r\n* boot archiso\r\n* install git (pacman -S git) / You might have to sync repos first with 'pacman -Syy'\r\n* clone this repo\r\n* cd into the dir, run 'chmod +x geronimo' to make executable\r\n* discover your ethernet with 'ip link' (usually starts with e like enp0s15)\r\n* use fdisk to partition drive with 1 swap and 1 root ([tutorial](https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=4#doc_chap4))\r\n* execute ./geronimo\r\n\r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n* add uefi support\r\n* add simple disk partitioning script\r\n* clean up code and increase efficiency/speed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
